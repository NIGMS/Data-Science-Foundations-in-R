    "## Experimental Design: SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Cell Lines\n",
    "\n",
    "This data comes from a pivotal study ([Blanco-Melo et al., Cell 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.026)) examining SARS-CoV-2 infection responses in cell culture models. This seminal paper, \"Imbalanced Host Response to SARS-CoV-2 Drives Development of COVID-19\", was one of the first to characterize the unique host response to SARS-CoV-2 and has been cited over 2,500 times. The experiment uses A549 cells, a human lung cancer cell line commonly used in respiratory virus research.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Groups\n",
    "The experiment includes two main series of comparisons:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Series 5: Standard A549 Cells\n",
    "* **Treatment Group**: SARS-CoV-2 infected (n=3)\n",
    " - GSM4462339, GSM4462340, GSM4462341\n",
    "* **Control Group**: Mock infected (n=3)\n",
    " - GSM4462336, GSM4462337, GSM4462338\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Series 16: Modified A549-ACE2 Cells\n",
    "These cells were engineered to express the ACE2 receptor, which SARS-CoV-2 uses to enter cells.\n",
    "* **Treatment Group**: SARS-CoV-2 infected (n=3)\n",
    " - GSM4486160, GSM4486161, GSM4486162\n",
    "* **Control Group**: Mock infected (n=3)\n",
    " - GSM4486157, GSM4486158, GSM4486159\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experimental Significance\n",
    "* A549 cells normally express very low levels of ACE2, the receptor SARS-CoV-2 uses to enter cells\n",
    "* By comparing standard A549 cells with ACE2-expressing A549 cells, researchers can:\n",
    " - Understand how the virus affects cells when it can and cannot efficiently enter\n",
    " - Identify cellular responses specific to viral entry versus exposure\n",
    " - Study how ACE2 expression levels impact infection outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Structure and Storage\n",
    "* Each sample has a unique GEO accession (GSM) number for metadata tracking\n",
    "* Each GSM is associated with one or more SRA run accessions (SRR numbers)\n",
    "* SRR files are stored in a specialized `.sra` format:\n",
    " - Binary format that efficiently stores sequencing reads\n",
    " - Contains both sequence data and quality scores\n",
    " - Requires special tools (SRA Toolkit) to convert to standard FASTQ format\n",
    " - More space-efficient than raw FASTQ files\n",
    " - Can represent both single-end and paired-end sequencing data\n",
    " - Acts as an archive format for sequence repositories\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Processing Flow\n",
    "1. GSM accessions identify the biological samples\n",
    "2. SRR numbers link to the actual sequencing data\n",
    "3. `.sra` files are downloaded using `prefetch`\n",
    "4. `.sra` files are converted to FASTQ using `fasterq-dump`\n",
    "5. FASTQ files are then processed for quality control and analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a cleaner, more modular approach to:\n",
    "1. Installing required bioinformatics tools\n",
    "2. Fetching SRA reads\n",
    "3. Running quality control with `fastp` + `MultiQC`\n",
    "4. Building a Salmon index\n",
    "5. Running Salmon quantification\n",

    "\n",
    "## RNA-seq Pipeline Package Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "The code cell below installs essential bioinformatics tools for RNA-seq analysis through conda.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Package Details and Purposes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Access and Download\n",
    "* [**entrez-direct**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK179288/) - Command-line tools for querying and downloading from NCBI databases. Essential for programmatically accessing sequence data from repositories like SRA and GenBank. It allows automated batch downloads and queries of NCBI's vast biological databases without manual web interface interaction.\n",
    "* [**sra-tools**](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools) - Official NCBI toolkit for working with Sequence Read Archive data. Required for downloading raw sequencing files. It handles the conversion of SRA's specialized format into standard FASTQ files that downstream tools can process.\n",
    "* [**parallel-fastq-dump**](https://github.com/rvalieris/parallel-fastq-dump) - Parallelized version of fastq-dump that significantly speeds up SRA data downloads. While the standard fastq-dump processes files sequentially, this tool utilizes multiple CPU cores to accelerate the download and conversion process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quality Control and Preprocessing\n",
    "* [**fastp**](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) - Modern all-in-one FASTQ preprocessor that handles quality control, adapter trimming, and filtering with exceptional speed. Unlike older tools that perform single tasks, fastp integrates multiple preprocessing steps including base quality control, adapter removal, quality filtering, and per-base quality pruning in a single efficient pass through the data.\n",
    "* [**FastQC**](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) - Industry standard tool for generating detailed quality control reports of sequencing data. It provides comprehensive visualizations and statistics about sequence quality scores, GC content, adapter contamination, overrepresented sequences, and other potential quality issues that might affect downstream analysis.\n",
    "* [**MultiQC**](https://multiqc.info/) - Aggregates bioinformatics analysis results across multiple samples into a single comprehensive report. This is particularly valuable for large-scale projects, as it combines reports from various tools (FastQC, Salmon, etc.) across many samples into an interactive HTML report, making it easier to spot batch effects or systematic issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quantification\n",
    "* [**Salmon**](https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon/) - A cutting-edge tool for transcript quantification that uses lightweight mapping (quasi-mapping) instead of traditional alignment. Unlike traditional aligners (like STAR or HISAT2) that generate BAM files with exact read positions, Salmon uses probabilistic models and lightweight mapping to estimate transcript abundances directly. This approach is substantially faster and more memory-efficient while maintaining high accuracy. It's particularly good at handling technical issues like multi-mapping reads and GC bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Utility\n",
    "* [**pigz**](https://zlib.net/pigz/) - Parallel implementation of gzip for efficient compression/decompression of large sequencing files. While standard gzip uses a single CPU core, pigz parallizes the compression/decompression process across multiple cores, significantly speeding up file operations on modern multi-core systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The installation uses specific conda channels:\n",
    "* `conda-forge`: General scientific computing packages, known for its comprehensive collection of well-maintained scientific software\n",
    "* `bioconda`: Specialized bioinformatics software channel, maintained by the bioinformatics community with standardized builds and dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "The `-y` flag automates the installation by accepting all prompts, allowing for unattended installation of all packages.\n",

    "* `check_sra_exists()` - Verifies if sequencing data has already been downloaded in SRA format to prevent redundant downloads.\n",
    "* `verify_fastq_exists()` - Checks if sequencing data has already been converted to FASTQ format to avoid duplicate processing.\n",
    "* `get_srr_dict()` - Retrieves SRA run accessions (SRR numbers) for each sample without downloading data. Creates a mapping between sample groups and their sequencing data.\n",
    "* `get_and_fetch_srr()` - Comprehensive function that:\n",
    " - Downloads raw sequencing data from NCBI\n",
    " - Converts it from SRA to FASTQ format \n",
    " - Compresses files to save space\n",
    " - Handles both single and paired-end data automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Processing and Quality Control\n",
    "* `run_fastp_with_concat()` - Processes raw sequencing data by:\n",
    " - Combining multiple sequencing runs for the same sample\n",
    " - Trimming low-quality bases\n",
    " - Removing adapter sequences\n",
    " - Generating quality reports\n",
    " - Creating cleaned, high-quality reads for downstream analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantification\n",
    "* `run_salmon_quant()` - Performs transcript quantification using Salmon by:\n",
    " - Processing cleaned reads from multiple runs per sample\n",
    " - Mapping reads to a reference transcriptome\n",
    " - Generating gene/transcript expression counts\n",
    " - Creating output compatible with downstream differential expression analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Each function includes error checking and progress reporting to ensure reliable data processing. The functions work together to create a seamless pipeline from raw data download through expression quantification."

    "## Understanding FASTQ Files in RNA-seq\n",
    "\n",
    "FASTQ files are the standard format for storing raw sequencing data in RNA-seq experiments. Each sequencing read in a FASTQ file consists of four lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "### FASTQ File Structure\n",
    "1. **Sequence Identifier** (starts with '@')\n",
    "  - Contains instrument ID, run information, and coordinates\n",
    "  - Example: `@SRR10971381.1 HWUSI-EAS100R:6:73:941:1973/1`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Raw Sequence**\n",
    "  - The actual DNA/RNA sequence using A, C, G, T (or U)\n",
    "  - Example: `ATCGTAGCTACGATCGACTGACTGACTACG`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Description Line** (starts with '+')\n",
    "  - Often just a '+' or repeats the identifier\n",
    "  - Separates sequence from quality scores\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Quality Scores** (Phred scores)\n",
    "  - ASCII-encoded quality values for each base\n",
    "  - Higher scores indicate more reliable base calls\n",
    "  - Example: `@@CCFFFFFHHHHHJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example FASTQ Entry\n",

    "\n",
    "Quality scores in FASTQ files are encoded using ASCII characters to save space and improve readability. Each base's quality score is represented by a single ASCII character.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "* Quality scores (Phred scores) range from 0 to 40+\n",
    "* These numbers are converted to ASCII characters by adding an offset\n",
    "* Two common encoding schemes:\n",
    "  - Phred+33: Offset of 33 (modern standard)\n",
    "  - Phred+64: Offset of 64 (older Illumina format)\n",

    "## Quality Control with fastp and MultiQC\n",
    "\n",
    "Before quantification, raw sequencing reads need quality control and preprocessing. We use two powerful tools: fastp for read processing and MultiQC for quality reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### fastp: Modern FASTQ Preprocessing\n",
    "`fastp` performs multiple essential steps in a single, efficient pass through the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Quality Control Metrics**\n",
    "  * Base quality distribution\n",
    "  * Sequence content analysis\n",
    "  * GC content distribution\n",
    "  * Sequence length distribution\n",
    "  * Duplication rate analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Read Trimming Actions**\n",
    "  * Removes low-quality bases (below Phred score threshold)\n",
    "  * Trims adapter sequences automatically\n",
    "  * Removes N bases\n",
    "  * Filters reads by length and complexity\n",
    "  * Performs sliding window quality trimming\n",

    "### Quality Assessment Flow\n",
    "1. Raw reads → fastp → Trimmed reads\n",
    "2. fastp generates per-sample reports\n",
    "3. MultiQC combines all reports\n",
    "4. Review MultiQC dashboard:\n",
    "  * Look for systematic quality issues\n",
    "  * Compare samples for batch effects\n",
    "  * Identify potential outliers\n",
    "  * Verify trimming effectiveness\n",
